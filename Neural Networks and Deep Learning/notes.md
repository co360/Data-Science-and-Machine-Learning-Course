Perceptron Model: 
 * We're basically trying to figure out how biological neurons works to have the computer atrifically mimic natural intelligence
 * A perceptron was a form of neural network (even Google Translate uses )
 * Imagine two datapoints, x1 and x2, and inside the perceptron there is some function f(x) that gives the output (y)
 * We can also add adjustable weights (w1 and w2) to add to each input of x to get a correct value of y 
 * We can also add bias terms (b) to account for zero values so that the inputs are multiplied by the weigths and added to the bias 
 * We can then expand this to create a generalization from i = 1 to i = n
